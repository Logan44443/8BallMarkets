Progress: Since Milestone 3, we focused on security, admin features, and creating a complete 
peer to peer betting ecosystem. We implemented RLS across all database tables 
with proper authentication context management. The app now features a comprehensive admin system 
for managing support tickets and resolving disputes, a third party arbiter system for neutral bet 
verification, and public profile pages. We added a leaderboard to showcase top performers, enhanced 
the UI with a British racing green theme, and created a robust test dataset with 8 users and varied 
betting scenarios. Environment variables now secure API keys, and users can sign up directly from 
the login page with a $1000 starting balance.
