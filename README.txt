Progress: Since the last milestone, as a team we updated our proposal, increasing the amount
of work for each person. We divided into different "Gurus" and each one is a part of the 
backend tech stack, and all them them work together to create the entire backend. Additionally,
we added a use of the react stack, which contains react.js which is the foundational library
for declarative and component based user interfases. Our backend is no.js which is a javascript
runtime environment. Each person explained what features their "guru" has, and then created
a small SQL schema table which will be the basis of the backend coding. We added a schedule for meetings 2
times a week to work together and make sure everyone continues doing their work.

Logan: proposed the User Guru, made the schema, wrote the README
Dylan: proposed the transactions Guru, made the transaction schema
Carlos: proposed the direct bets and AI gurus and made the schemas
Lukas: proposed the comments/discussion and support guru and made the schema
Leonardo: proposed social guru and made the schema
Alain: figured out tech stack and the order book (non-direct bets) guru and made the schema
